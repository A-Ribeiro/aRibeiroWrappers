## The Library

I started to code an opensource library called OpenGLStarter.

The code become so big, that I decided to split it into independent libraries.

I splitted the code according its area.

For example: The math and basic utilities I called aRibeiroCore; The platform related code (thread, sleep, timer, etc...) I called aRibeiroPlatform, etc...

I have a WIP documentation at the [docs](docs/index.md) folder.

I hope this code could help/aid the development of great projects.
